                    Hello! I’m Mark Vale, a passionate and driven video game designer and developer with a foundation in both Unity and Unreal Engine.<br><br> Recently, I graduated from the Toronto Film School Video Game Development and Design program, where I honed my skills in C#, Blueprints, and C++. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained hands-on experience working on a variety of projects, including my role as the technical Design Lead for our capstone project.

                    In addition to my technical expertise, I bring a unique perspective to game development. Before diving into game design, I spent over a decade as a Snowboard instructor, Snowboard course designer and a CASI Snowboard Evaluator, where I developed and led various training programs. This experience has shaped my approach to problem-solving and team collaboration, helping me think creatively and develop engaging, user-focused experiences.<br><br>
                
                    Whether I'm designing gameplay mechanics, scripting, or leading a team of developers, my goal is always to create immersive and enjoyable experiences for players. I thrive in environments where I can blend my technical skills with my passion for design, and I'm excited about the opportunity to bring new ideas to life in the gaming world.
                    
                    Feel free to explore my portfolio and see some of the projects I’ve worked on. <br><br> If you’d like to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
